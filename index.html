<p> My name is Alex. I am originally brom Bakersfield California and moved to San Diego after graduating high school in 2009. I went to Mesa Community College for a few years, then I transfered to California Lutheran University. I graduated in 2015 with a Bachelors degree in Business Administration. 
<br><br>
Tennis and surfing are some of my favorite hobbies. I've been playing tennis since I was a kid. Most of my family plays/played tennis and got me into the sport at a very young age. I enjoy some good quality time with family and friends.
